      "question": "After starting the simulation, why are items processed in descending order of value-to-weight ratio?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The objective is not to minimize item count but to maximize value.",

        "a": "No more items are left",

        "a": "Items may still exist but cannot be added.",

        "a": "Skipped items show no percentage taken.",

        "a": "Because all combinations are tested",
        "b": "Because the problem satisfies the greedy choice property",
